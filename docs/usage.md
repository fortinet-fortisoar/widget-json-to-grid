# Usage

The JSON to Grid widget helps render the JSON list result returned from the **JSON Data Provider** Playbook in a grid view. It also has the option to add playbooks as action buttons.

## Features

- Configure the widget by choosing *Title*, *Playbook Collection*, *Playbooks*, and *Icons*

- Visualize the JSON data result from the playbook specified under the `JSON Data Provider Playbook` field

- Execute the playbooks either when **_no records are selected_** or when one or more **_records are selected_** on grid data

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>NOTE</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>The playbook <em>JSON Data Provider</em> must return <strong>two</strong> variables:
                <ol>
                    <li><code>grid_data</code>: Contains the list of JSON data to render on grid view. Every record should have a unique IRI (<code>@id</code>) field.</li>
                    <li><code>grid_columns</code>: Map <code>grid_data</code> variable fields with the column fields of the grid.</li>
                </ol>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

## Configuring JSON to Grid Widget

In this section, we use *Continuos Delivery* solution pack as an example for configuring the **JSON to Grid** widget.

1. Edit a module's view template and select the **Add Widget** button.

2. Select **JSON to Grid** from the list of installed widgets.

3. Specify a title of the widget in the **Title** field.

4. Select the playbook collection containing the playbooks to execute. This collection must also contain the playbooks to be executed as action buttons.

    As an example, select the collection **02 - Use Case - CICD**.

5. Select the playbook that returns the JSON data to be rendered in the grid view.
